# Movie Search
<p>A simply application that I made by following a course on Udemy. Added a few features but it is still very basic. Basically allows you to search for a movie. Clicking on the movie poster will take you to that movie's IMDb page. That's it!</p>
<p>Made using the OMDB API, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express and SASS</p>
